# Song Popularity Prediction

### Background

For musicians, record companies, and music streaming services, a song's popularity is essential since it can decide the success of a new release or even an entire career. Professionals in the music business can plan their marketing, promotion, and distribution strategies by forecasting which songs are most likely to catch on. Researchers and music industry professionals alike have a unique opportunity to investigate and comprehend the aspects that influence song popularity and trends by analyzing huge music datasets. By utilizing these resources, stakeholders can develop new winning strategies for an extremely competitive market and make data-driven decisions.

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can precisely predict a song's popularity based on its acoustic characteristics and artistâ€™s information. Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be used to assess the model's performance.
