# Song Popularity Prediction

### Background

For musicians, record companies, and music streaming services, a song's popularity is essential since it can decide the success of a new release or even an entire career. Professionals in the music business can plan their marketing, promotion, and distribution strategies by forecasting which songs are most likely to catch on. Researchers and music industry professionals alike have a unique opportunity to investigate and comprehend the aspects that influence song popularity and trends by analyzing huge music datasets. By utilizing these resources, stakeholders can develop new winning strategies for an extremely competitive market and make data-driven decisions.

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can precisely predict a song's popularity based on its acoustic characteristics and artist’s information. Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be used to assess the model's performance.

### Significance

The music industry professionals can save time and money if song popularity can be predicted accurately, making this issue crucial. They can utilize machine learning models to forecast the success of a new song or album before it is released instead of depending on trial-and-error techniques. This can lessen financial risk and raise the likelihood of success in the cutthroat music business.

### Project Potential
Some instances where our project might be crucial is:

- The music industry professionals can use their resources more efficiently if they can accurately predict a song's level of popularity. The music industry may concentrate on advertising songs that are expected to be popular rather than spending money promoting
a song that may or may not be popular.

- The music industry can enhance its artist choosing process with precise song popularity
estimates. This can assist the industry in identifying fresh potential and helping it decide
whether to support a given artist.

- The music industry can boost the amount of streams and downloads, which will increase
income, by marketing songs that are expected to be popular. Resulting in a boost of income.

### Data Sources
We are utilizing the dataset produced by the Brazilian Federal University of Minas Gerais' computer science department. The dataset comes in a zip format divided into 3 directories — metadata, popularity, and song features. These directories contain multiple CSVs representing different tables of the MusiOSet dataset. The dataset contains more than 20,000 rows that are dispersed across several tables and we merge all the tables to obtain our initial data collection.
